Commemorative stamp issue: "The 150th Anniversary of the Birth of Dr. SUN Yat-sen"
**********************************************************************************

     Hongkong Post announced today (October 28) that a set of commemorative stamps with a theme of "The 150th Anniversary of the Birth of Dr. SUN Yat-sen", with associated philatelic products, will be released for sale on November 12 (Saturday).
 
     Dr Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) was an eminent patriot, a national hero and an enlightened leader for democracy in China. His leadership and revolutionary spirit inspired the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, which successfully overturned the ruling Qing dynasty. The Revolution not only put an end to the absolute monarchic rule that had governed China for thousands of years, but also paved the way for national progress and marked a new chapter in history for the transformation and advancement of old China.
 
     As November 12 will be the 150th anniversary of the birth of Dr Sun, Hongkong Post is issuing a set of stamps to commemorate this preeminent leader. Dr Sun had a profound relationship with Hong Kong, where he received his education and nurtured his revolutionary thoughts. A set of four stamps, presented in the style of an oil painting, reminisces on important events in Dr Sun's life by depicting his footprints in Hong Kong in different periods.
 
     To commemorate the anniversary, China Post, Hongkong Post and Macao Post will jointly issue a souvenir pack on the same day. The joint souvenir pack encompasses a souvenir sheet containing a complete set of stamps issued by the three postal administrations.
 
     Official First Day Covers will be on sale at $1.20 each at all post offices from October 29. The stamps and the associated philatelic products will be displayed at the General Post Office, Tsim Sha Tsui Post Office, Tsuen Wan Post Office, Sha Tin Central Post Office and Tuen Mun Central Post Office from the same day. Advance orders for servicing self-provided covers will be accepted at all philatelic offices from October 29 to November 4. 
 
    All post offices and philatelic offices will maintain their normal Saturday business hours on November 12 (please refer to Hongkong Post's website at www.hongkongpost.hk for details).
 
     Information about this special stamp issue is available on Hongkong Post's website at www.hongkongpost.hk and the Hongkong Post mobile app.

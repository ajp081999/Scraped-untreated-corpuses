LegCo to debate motion on not forgetting June 4 incident
********************************************************

The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

     The Legislative Council (LegCo) will hold a meeting on Wednesday (April 3) at 11.30am (or immediately after the meeting for the Chief Executive's Question Time to be held at 11am) in the Chamber of the LegCo Complex. During the meeting, Members will debate a motion on not forgetting the June 4 incident.

     The motion, moved by Mr Wu Chi-wai, states: "That this Council urges that: the June 4 incident be not forgotten and the 1989 pro-democracy movement be vindicated."

     Members will also debate on a motion on requesting the Government to overcome the "three big mountains" in people's livelihood. The motion, moved by Ms Alice Mak, states: "That improving people's livelihood is a key policy theme of the current-term Government; in recent years, the local community has been plagued by 'three big mountains' in people's livelihood (i.e. Link Real Estate Investment Trust (Link REIT), the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL), and the offsetting mechanism for the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)), which have added burden on people's livelihood; as Link REIT is not subject to the Government's restraint and monopolises shopping arcades and markets in communities, shop and stall rents have risen substantially, and this has directly pushed up the prices of livelihood-related commodities; in the case of MTRCL, the lack of competition in railway operation and its ineffective management and works supervision have led to a decline in its service quality, and it has still increased its fares year after year under the Fare Adjustment Mechanism despite successive incidents; and the MPF offsetting mechanism has eroded employees' rights and interests over the years, significantly undermining MPF's function of providing retirement protection; in this connection, this Council requests the Government to expeditiously formulate measures to overcome the 'three big mountains' in people's livelihood, so as to bring benefits to the livelihood of people from various strata, reduce their discontent, and in turn achieve social harmony."
     
     Mr Kwok Wai-keung, Mr Ho Kai-ming, Mr Luk Chung-hung, Mr Leung Yiu-chung, Dr Kwok Ka-ki, Dr Fernando Cheung, Mr Chu Hoi-dick and Mr Au Nok-hin will move separate amendments to Ms Mak's motion.
    
     On Government Bills, the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 will be introduced into the Council for the First Reading and the Second Reading. The Second Reading debate on the Bill will be adjourned.
    
     On Government Motions, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare will move three proposed resolutions under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, the Pneumoconiosis and Mesothelioma (Compensation) Ordinance and the Occupational Deafness (Compensation) Ordinance respectively, to amend the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, the Pneumoconiosis and Mesothelioma (Compensation) Ordinance and the Occupational Deafness (Compensation) Ordinance as set out in Appendix 1, Appendix 2 and Appendix 3.
    
     On Member's Bills, the Second Reading debate on Professional Accountants (Amendment) Bill 2018 will resume. If the Bill is supported by Members and receives its Second Reading, it will stand committed to the committee of the whole Council. After the committee of the whole Council has completed consideration of the Bill and its report is adopted by the Council, the Bill will be set down for the Third Reading.
    
     During the meeting, Members will also ask the Government 22 questions on various policy areas, six of which require oral replies.

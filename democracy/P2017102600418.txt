Transcript of remarks by CE at media session (with video)
*********************************************************

     Following is the transcript of remarks by the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, at a media session after attending the Master Insight Forum this morning (October 26):
 
Reporter: Mrs Lam, you are basically denouncing the pro-democracy camp for filibustering, but they are saying that your Government, your administration, is disrespectful to LegCo by introducing that non-binding motion and now you are saying that you're going to, parallel, you might also introduce, go on with the process of introducing, the co-location plan. Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of your plans to introduce that at LegCo?
 
Chief Executive: No. First of all, I have to challenge what you said, that introducing a non-binding motion on the subject of co-location is disrespectful of Legislative Council. So you have premised your question on the wrong basis. This is a true reflection of respect for the Legislative Council because, since we announced the co-location proposal in late July, there have been three months of public discussion, so by proposing a non-binding government motion we are providing an opportunity for members of the Legislative Council to debate and reflect their views on the co-location proposal before we commence the legislative process. So that act itself is a full respect for members of the Legislative Council. But, if some of the members of the Legislative Council use this process to filibuster, to delay the discussion and the resolution of the government motion, then being a responsible Government, I have no choice but to do what is right for the purpose of this exercise. The purpose of this exercise is the broad community wants us to commission the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail upon its completion. So if that objective could not be met because of objection and disruption by some of the members of the Legislative Council, the Government could not just sit back and watch the situation. We have to respond, and respond in a very responsible way.
 
Reporter: Does that mean that the lawmakers only have two more weeks to discuss and pass that non-binding motion before you will take further action?
 
Chief Executive: I have not said that. I will watch the situation very closely to decide what is the responsible step that the Government should take in order to commission the high-speed rail Hong Kong section on time, that is the third quarter of 2018, to meet the wishes of the community.

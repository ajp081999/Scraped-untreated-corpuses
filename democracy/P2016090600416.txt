Transcript of remarks by CE at media session before ExCo meeting (with video)
*****************************************************************************

     Following is the transcript of remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr C Y Leung, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting this morning (September 6):
 
Reporter: Mr Leung, how does this LegCo result, election result, affect your chance, your decision whether to run for a second term as the CE? And how would the Government try to work with these new LegCo candidates?

Chief Executive: The LegCo election results have nothing to do with the chances of anyone who aspires to be the next Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Secondly, let me just repeat myself. The Government is very pleased at the high turnout rate. The Government has been promoting voter registration and also asking people to come out to vote. And this is a very important part in our democracy and also the development of our democracy in Hong Kong.
 
      We are pleased to see a number of new faces who serve as LegCo members for the first time and the Government will continue to work with LegCo as we did in the past, and I ask my senior colleagues to start engaging members of the Legislative Council, particularly members who are elected for the first time. It is important that the Hong Kong Government, as the executive authorities of Hong Kong, work with LegCo members and vice versa. I think the people have spoken. One observation is that a primary reason for several, if you like, radical members of LegCo who lost their re-election campaign is because the voters did not agree with their radical behaviours, particularly the filibustering which really dragged Hong Kong down. So that's one observation. I am sure there are other observations, but as I said the people have spoken.

     A spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (October 14) expressed regret over an assembly at Chater Garden in Central which urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
 
     The spokesman said, "Since the return to the Motherland, the HKSAR has been exercising 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The 'one country, two systems' principle has been fully and successfully implemented. Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The HKSAR Government attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them."
 
     The spokesman reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.

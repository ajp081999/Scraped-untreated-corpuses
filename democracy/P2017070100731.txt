Government responds to July 1 procession
****************************************

     In response to the procession today (July 1), a Government spokesman said the following:
                
     "In accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the National People's Congress enacted the Basic Law, prescribing the systems to be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), in order to ensure the implementation of the basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong, i.e. 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy.
                
     "The Basic Law is the constitutional document of the HKSAR and also a national law of the country. Apart from maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, the Basic Law also protects and upholds core values such as freedom, human rights, democracy, rule of law and clean governance. The fundamental rights and duties of Hong Kong residents are also clearly stated in the Basic Law.
                
     "Since the return to the Motherland, the HKSAR Government has been implementing 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the Basic Law. 
                
     "We will continue to make the best use of the advantages of 'one country' and 'two systems' and grasp the huge opportunities brought about by the country's development, with a view to proactively developing the economy of Hong Kong and improving the livelihood of people.
                
     "On constitutional development, we understand Hong Kong people's desire for universal suffrage. However, given the extremely controversial nature of the issue, we must prudently consider all related factors and seek consensus at a suitable juncture and in appropriate circumstances. The current-term Government will do its best to work towards creating a favourable atmosphere to take forward this task."

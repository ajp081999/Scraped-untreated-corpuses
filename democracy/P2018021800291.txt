     Following is the transcript of remarks by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (February 18):

Reporter: Mr Cheung, while you said you welcome young people from across the political spectrum to join the government programmes that nurturing young politicians, how do you expect young people from pro-democracy side, or even localists to join your programmes? Or how would you attract them?

Chief Secretary for Administration: We are open in terms of listening ideas from all people in Hong Kong. Look at the young people, the self-recommendation scheme is proved to be a huge success. We've got over 1 100 applications, applying purely for 11 posts, so 100 people is applying for one position. They are all unpaid or voluntary work, but the candidates are of very high quality, very serious and coming for interview panel session. So I am very encouraged by the overwhelming response, and I am sure this will be a new beginning, a good breakthrough, in terms of establishing communication, establishing rapport with our young people.

     Mr Lam Cheuk-ting will move a motion on combating bid-rigging to defend the rights and interests of property owners. The motion states: "That in recent years building maintenance works in Hong Kong have been monopolised by bid-rigging syndicates involving triad members, and such syndicates manipulate tendering process by unlawful means, including significantly inflating maintenance costs to make huge profits, thus causing property owners to suffer losses of tens of billions of dollars, and arousing widespread grievances among members of the public; in order to combat the illegal activities of bid-rigging, this Council urges the Government to:
 
			(1)				expeditiously plug the relevant loopholes under the Building Management Ordinance to safeguard the rights and interests of property owners;	
			(2)				step up law enforcement to deter bid-rigging syndicates;	
			(3)				enhance public promotion and education to enable members of the public to understand the perils of bid-rigging and take precautions;	
			(4)				provide property owners with professional support to enable them to comprehensively grasp the correct information on building maintenance works; and	
			(5)				set up a 'building maintenance works authority' to centrally monitor the conduct of the industry and quality of maintenance."	

     Mr Lau Kwok-fan, Mr Alvin Yeung, Dr Fernando Cheung and Mr Kwok Wai-keung will move separate amendments to Mr Lam Cheuk-ting's motion.

     In addition, Mr Chan Chun-ying will move a proposed resolution under section 34(4) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance to extend the period for amending the Financial Institutions (Resolution) (Protected Arrangements) Regulation and the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance (Commencement) Notice 2017 laid on the table of the Council on May 17, 2017 to the meeting of July 5, 2017.

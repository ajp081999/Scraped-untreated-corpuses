SCS on civil service pay adjustment
***********************************

     Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Joshua Law, at a media session at the Central Government Offices today (July 20):

Reporter: Do you agree with some of the pro-democracy members saying that it wouldn't be a big deal, because the salary can be traced back after all?

Secretary for the Civil Service: We think it is important that issues like the pay adjustment for civil servants, which is not controversial, should be accorded high priority and receive their attention and get approved as soon as possible.

Reporter: Are you saying that some of the pro-democracy members have to take the responsibility for not having that passed?

Secretary for the Civil Service: As I said, the issue about civil service pay adjustment is non-controversial and is not a political issue. I hope all parties will have the interests of the public in mind and expedite the processing and the approval of the proposal as soon as possible after the resumption of the business after summer.

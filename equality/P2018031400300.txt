****************************************************

     The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Dr Law Chi-kwong, commenced his visit programme in New York on March 13 (New York time) with his delegation.

     In the morning, Dr Law first called on the Deputy Consul General of the People's Republic of China in New York, Dr Zhao Yumin, to update him on the recent developments in Hong Kong. He also met with the Executive Director of the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity of New York City, Mr Matthew Klein, and exchanged views on policies to alleviate poverty.

     Dr Law noted that the office analyses poverty relief policies and develops new intervention measures covering enhancement of child care services and after-school care programmes, as well as social inclusion for ethnic minorities to support the workforce including women. He was also briefed on the initiative on data sharing to better co-ordinate the provision of welfare services to clients and their families.

     He then addressed a luncheon jointly organised by the Hong Kong Association of New York, Asian Women in Business and the International Women's Entrepreneurial Challenge Foundation. Speaking on Hong Kong's experience in women's empowerment, he pointed out that Hong Kong women are playing an increasingly important role in various professions. Noting that Hong Kong is facing the challenge of a rapidly ageing population, Dr Law said initiatives are being taken by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government to enable women to make a choice for work and help further unleash the potential of women in the labour force.

     In the afternoon, Dr Law met with the delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Women attending the 62nd session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW). He said he was glad to see secondary school students in the delegation and encouraged them to promote gender equality among their peers.

     As part of the Chinese delegation, Dr Law attended a meeting of the UNCSW on accelerating implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and achieving concrete results by 2020.

     He will attend a ministerial segment on March 14 (New York time) on women's access to the media as well as information and communications technologies.

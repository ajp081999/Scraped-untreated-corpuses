**************************************

     The Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, accompanied by the Commissioner of Police, Mr Lo Wai-chung, and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Kwok Yam-shu, today (October 21) paid a visit to the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui to meet with representatives of the Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong and other leaders of the local Muslim community.

     Mrs Lam and Mr Lo explained again to the Muslim representatives regarding the use of a Specialised Crowd Management Vehicle and coloured water outside the mosque by Police yesterday afternoon (October 20). Mrs Lam extended an apology for the inadvertent spraying of the mosque's main entrance and gate with coloured water during an operation.

     Mrs Lam said that the Muslim community has all along called Hong Kong their home, making contributions to the city's society, which is pluralistic, inclusive, open and lives peacefully with other groups. Mrs Lam expressed gratitude to the Muslim leaders who, in the face of the disputes and violent incidents in Hong Kong in recent months, appealed on various occasions to members of the public and the Muslim community to stay calm and united to collectively safeguard Hong Kong. Emphasising that the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will continue to build a society with equality and inclusiveness, while providing various services for ethnic minorities including the Muslim community, Mrs Lam expressed the hope of working together with them to restore calm in Hong Kong as soon as possible.

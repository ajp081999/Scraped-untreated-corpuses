Mr CP HO (Chairman, International Social Services Hong Kong Branch), Miss Bernardita Catalla (Consul-General of the Philippines), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

     Good afternoon.  It gives me great pleasure to join you all today at the Opening Ceremony of "Celebrate Colours" multi-cultural extravaganza. 

     Over more than a century, Hong Kong has transformed itself from a traditional Chinese society into an international city where the East meets the West.  The presence of various ethnic groups in Hong Kong has positively influenced the daily lives of Hong Kong people on all fronts, from arts, music, culture and food to education, business and social services, making Hong Kong a thriving cultural hub.  This is evidenced by some 8 000 art performances presented by over 1 000 art groups every year and the fact that Hong Kong is a destination for world renowned art events such as Art Basel, Art Central, Hong Kong International Film Festival and Le French May.

     This year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).  The HKSAR Government has joined hands with different sectors to organise a variety of celebration activities under the theme of "Together • Progress • Opportunity".  Togetherness is the lynchpin for progress.  As a free and open society with various ethnic groups, Hong Kong upholds the principles of mutual respect and inclusiveness.  Our neighbourhood spirit and cohesive synergy have helped the city go from strength to strength, allowing us to contribute to the Motherland while maintaining our global outlook.

     The "Celebrate Colours" cultural extravaganza has adopted "Hong Kong is Home" as its theme to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR.  Multi-cultural performing groups of different ethnic origins, including Filipino, Chinese, Indonesian, Thai, Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, will showcase the remarkable friendship and cohesiveness established between the local and ethnic communities in Hong Kong through presentation of their talents, cultures and skills.

     Hong Kong is home to a diverse and multi-racial community, where more than 200 000 ethnic minority people have chosen to settle.  I truly appreciate that many ethnic minorities, having been here for generations, still play important roles in shaping the city's history and contribute to making our home a better place to live in.  We embrace the value of racial equality that makes us an inclusive, cohesive and strong community.  There are also a significant 360 000 foreign domestic helpers here.  They contribute greatly to many local families over the years.  I  am sure that we are appreciative of their important roles.  The Government will continue to develop Hong Kong into a socially inclusive society.  Let's work together towards this goal.

     Finally, I would like to wish the cultural extravaganza a great success and all of you a most enjoyable time.

     Thank you very much.

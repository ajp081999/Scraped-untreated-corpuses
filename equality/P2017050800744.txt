*****************************************************************

The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:
     
     The Legislative Council (LegCo) will hold a meeting on Wednesday (May 10) at 11am in the Chamber of the LegCo Complex. During the meeting, Members will continue to consider the amendments to the Appropriation Bill 2017. Ms Claudia Mo, Dr Cheng Chung-tai, Mr Jeremy Tam, Mr Kwong Chun-yu, Mr Lam Cheuk-ting, Mr James To, Mr Andrew Wan, Dr Helena Wong, Mr Wu Chi-wai, Mr Ip Kin-yuen, Mr Hui Chi-fung, Dr Yiu Chung-yim, Mr Chan Chi-chuen, Dr Lau Siu-lai, Dr Fernando Cheung, Dr Kwok Ka-ki, Mr Leung Kwok-hung, Mr Shiu Ka-chun, Mr Nathan Law and Mr Chu Hoi-dick will move a total of 185 amendments to the Bill at the Committee stage.

     The Private Columbaria Bill will go through the Committee stage and be read the third time. 

     On Government motions, the Secretary for Transport and Housing will move a proposed resolution under the Road Traffic Ordinance to seek the Council to extend the period for which the limit specified in the Road Traffic (Public Light Buses: Limit on Number) Notice 2016 on the total number of vehicles that may be registered as public light buses remains in force to June 20, 2022.

     The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury will move a proposed resolution under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance to seek the Council to approve the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (Fees) (Amendment) Regulation 2017 made by the Chief Executive in Council on March 14, 2017.

     On Members' motions, Dr Kwok Ka-ki will move a motion on urging the next Chief Executive to reactivate constitutional reform. The motion states: "That this Council urges the next Chief Executive to request the Central People's Government to seek the invalidation by the National People's Congress (NPC) of the decision made by the Standing Committee of NPC on August 31, 2014 on Hong Kong's constitutional development, and reactivate the statutory process for constitutional reform to allow Hong Kong people to, by way of nomination with no screening, including civil nomination, elect the Chief Executive on a 'one person, one vote' basis; and to abolish the functional constituencies in the Legislative Council to allow Hong Kong people to elect all Legislative Council Members by direct elections, so as to implement genuine dual universal suffrage under the principles of universality and equality, thereby manifesting 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy, and hence eliminating deep-rooted social conflicts."

     Mr Leung Che-cheung and Dr Helena Wong will move separate amendments to Dr Kwok's motion.

     Ms Claudia Mo will also move a motion on promoting "Hong Kong people using Hong Kong water" and protecting local resources. The motion states: "That this Council urges the next term Government to expedite the promotion of 'Hong Kong people using Hong Kong water' by increasing the application of desalination technology in Hong Kong, so as to reduce reliance on Dongjiang water; besides, since frequent occurrence of reservoir overflow wastes a huge amount of local water resources, the next term Government should revise the approach of purchasing Dongjiang water, switching from the 'package deal lump sum' approach to a 'quantity-based charging' approach."

     Dr Helena Wong, Mr Lau Kwok-fan and Mr Kenneth Leung will move separate amendments to Ms Mo's motion.

     During the meeting, Members will ask the Government 22 questions on various policy areas, all of which require written replies. 

     The agenda of the above meeting can be obtained via the LegCo website (www.legco.gov.hk). Please note that the agenda is subject to change, and the latest information about the agenda could be found on the LegCo website.

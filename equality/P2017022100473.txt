     Over 600 people from local women's groups, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the business sector, the academic sector and those who are interested in women's issues attended a conference entitled "Unleashing Women's Potential for All-Round Development" at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre today (February 21).

     The conference, the fifth of its kind hosted by the Women's Commission (WoC) since its inception in 2001, aimed to provide a platform for participants to discuss and exchange views on issues and strategy related to the development of women. It also aimed to share the views of women's groups and their needs and to foster a close partnership with them. The conference was also one of the events for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).

     Officiating at the conference this afternoon were the Chief Executive, Mr C Y Leung; Vice President and Member of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation Madam Cui Yu; Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Mr Yang Jian; the Chair of the Bureau of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, Mr Antonio de Aguiar Patriota; the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung; the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Stephen Sui; the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Annie Tam; and the Chairperson of the WoC, Mrs Stella Lau.

     There were two plenary sessions at the conference. In the first session, Mr Cheung and the Deputy Director of the Women's Studies Institute of China, All-China Women's Federation, Dr Du Jie, introduced the developments in promoting women's all-round development in Hong Kong and the Mainland and the challenges ahead. In the second session, Mr Patriota and Mr Sui spoke about the role of males in promoting women's all-round development and gender equality in the international arena and in Hong Kong, with a view to unleashing the potential and talents of both sexes.

     Speaking at the closing ceremony, Mrs Lau said that in the continuing effort to promote gender mainstreaming, the WoC, following the setting up of the Gender Focal Point (GFP) networks in the Government and among the District Councils and NGOs in the social welfare sector, has set up another GFP network for listed companies to promote gender awareness in the private sector. So far, some 160 listed companies have set up GFPs. These newly appointed GFPs, together with others from the business sector, attended the lunchtime talk under the theme "Promoting Women's Development - Role of the Business Sector" today.

     Four breakout sessions were also held on the following topics: "Promoting Gender Mainstreaming", "Women's Role in Society", "Empowerment of Women in the Workplace" and "Empowerment of Women through Community Resources". The speakers and participants shared their views and valuable experience on how to promote women's development through various aspects in the community.

     A mini-exhibition was also set up alongside the conference to showcase awarded projects under the Award Scheme in Promoting Women's Economic Empowerment organised by the Labour and Welfare Bureau and the WoC, and the winning entries of the School Competitions organised by the WoC.

     A pre-conference activity with the theme "Women in the Spotlight" was also held yesterday (February 20). Activities were organised by women's groups and NGOs to showcase the potential of women in an interactive, creative and lively manner. Over 600 members of the public participated in the event.

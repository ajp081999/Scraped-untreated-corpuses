Government invites public views on fourth CEDAW report
******************************************************

     The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) issued today (March 1) a draft outline of its fourth report under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to seek views from members of the public. The report will be submitted to the Central People's Government for incorporation into the ninth national periodic report.

    The CEDAW was extended to Hong Kong in October 1996 and has remained in force to date. The Convention is concerned with the elimination of discrimination against women, and the development and advancement of women in all fields in Hong Kong.

     In accordance with Article 18 of the Convention, each state party undertakes to submit a report on measures taken to give effect to the provisions of the Convention and on the progress made in this respect for consideration by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (the Committee).

     As part of the combined seventh and eighth national periodic reports, the HKSAR Government submitted its third report on the implementation of the CEDAW to the United Nations in 2012, which was considered by the Committee in October 2014.

     A spokesman for the Labour and Welfare Bureau said, "We will provide an update on the administrative, legal and other measures taken to implement the Convention; progress made in promoting women's well-being; changes in the status of women and equality of the sexes as well as obstacles to the full achievement of the Convention since the previous report. We will also address in the report the various concerns and recommendations made by the Committee at the last hearing held in 2014."

     The consultation period, beginning today, will last for two months until April 30. Two public consultation sessions will be arranged in April for interested parties to express their views. Details will be announced in due course.

     "We will incorporate the comments received and our response to them in the report as far as possible," the spokesman said.

     The draft outline of the fourth CEDAW report can be downloaded from the websites of the Labour and Welfare Bureau (www.lwb.gov.hk) and the Women's Commission (www.women.gov.hk), or obtained from the Home Affairs Enquiry Centres in 18 districts.

     For enquiries, please contact the Labour and Welfare Bureau by telephone (2810 3827), fax (2501 0478) or email (cedaw_consultation@lwb.gov.hk).

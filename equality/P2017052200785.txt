The motion states: "That this Council urges the next-term Government to expedite the promotion of 'Hong Kong people using Hong Kong water' by increasing the application of desalination technology in Hong Kong, so as to reduce reliance on Dongjiang water; besides, since frequent occurrence of reservoir overflow wastes a huge amount of local water resources, the next-term Government should revise the approach of purchasing Dongjiang water, switching from the 'package deal lump sum' approach to a 'quantity-based charging' approach."

     Dr Helena Wong, Mr Lau Kwok-fan and Mr Kenneth Leung will move separate amendments to Ms Claudia Mo's motion.

     During the meeting, Members will ask the Government 22 questions on various policy areas, six of which require oral replies.

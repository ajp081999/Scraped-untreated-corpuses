LegCo to debate motion on urging next Chief Executive to reactivate constitutional reform
*****************************************************************************************

The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

     The Legislative Council (LegCo) will hold a meeting on Wednesday (May 31) at 11am in the Chamber of the LegCo Complex.  During the meeting, Members will debate a motion on urging the next Chief Executive to reactivate constitutional reform.

     The motion, moved by Dr Kwok Ka-ki, states: "That this Council urges the next Chief Executive to request the Central People's Government to seek the invalidation by the National People's Congress (NPC) of the decision made by the Standing Committee of NPC on August 31, 2014 on Hong Kong's constitutional development, and reactivate the statutory process for constitutional reform to allow Hong Kong people to, by way of nomination with no screening, including civil nomination, elect the Chief Executive on a 'one person, one vote' basis; and to abolish the functional constituencies in the Legislative Council to allow Hong Kong people to elect all Legislative Council Members by direct elections, so as to implement genuine dual universal suffrage under the principles of universality and equality, thereby manifesting 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and 'a high degree of autonomy', and hence eliminating deep-rooted social conflicts."

     Mr Leung Che-cheung and Dr Helena Wong will move separate amendments to Dr Kwok Ka-ki's motion.

     Members will also debate on a motion moved by Dr Cheng Chung-tai under the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance.  The motion states: "That this Council appoints a select committee to inquire into the incident of the loss of the notebook computers of the Registration and Electoral Office containing the personal data of all registered electors in Hong Kong at the AsiaWorld-Expo, the fallback venue of the 2017 Chief Executive Election, and other related matters; and that in the performance of its duties the committee be authorised under section 9(2) of the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance (Cap. 382) to exercise the powers conferred by section 9(1) of that Ordinance."

     In addition, Ms Claudia Mo will move a motion on promoting "Hong Kong people using Hong Kong water" and protecting local resources.  The motion states: "That this Council urges the next-term Government to expedite the promotion of 'Hong Kong people using Hong Kong water' by increasing the application of desalination technology in Hong Kong, so as to reduce reliance on Dongjiang water; besides, since frequent occurrence of reservoir overflow wastes a huge amount of local water resources, the next-term Government should revise the approach of purchasing Dongjiang water, switching from the 'package deal lump sum' approach to a 'quantity-based charging' approach."

     Dr Helena Wong, Mr Lau Kwok-fan and Mr Kenneth Leung will move separate amendments to Ms Claudia Mo's motion.

     Members will also ask the Government 22 questions on various policy areas, six of which require oral replies.
